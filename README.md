## üöÄ About Dot

Dot is a standalone, open-source application designed for seamless interaction with documents and files using local LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It is inspired by solutions like Nvidia's Chat with RTX, providing a user-friendly interface for those without a programming background. Using the Phi-3.5 LLM by default, Dot ensures accessibility and simplicity right out of the box.

### üìú What does it do?

Dot allows you to load multiple documents into an LLM and interact with them in a fully local environment. Supported document types include PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, and more! Users can also engage with Big Dot for inquiries not directly related to their documents, similar to interacting with ChatGPT.

### üîß How does it work?

Built with Electron JS, The application uses libraries such as FAISS for creating local vector stores, Langchain, llama.cpp & Huggingface for setting up conversation chains, and additional tools for document management and interaction.

## üì• Install

**To use Dot:**
- Visit the [Dot website](https://dotapp.uk/) to download the application for Apple Silicon or Windows.

**For developers:**
- Clone the repository `$ https://github.com/alexpinel/Dot.git`
- Install Node js and then run `npm install` inside the project repository, you can run `npm install --force` if you face any issues at this stage. Once complete, move to `cd aadotllm` and run `npm install` once more!

## üåü Future Features I'd Like to Add

- Linux support
- Choice of LLM - Done!
- Image file support
- Enhanced document awareness beyond content
- Simplified file loading (select individual files, not just folders)
- Increased security measures for using local LLMs
- Support for additional document types
- Efficient file database management for quicker access to groups of files
